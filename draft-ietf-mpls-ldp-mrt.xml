    <abstract>

     <t>This document specifies extensions to the Label Distribution
     Protocol(LDP) to support the creation of label-switched paths for
     Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  A prime use of MRTs is for
     unicast and multicast IP/LDP Fast-Reroute, which we will refer to
     as MRT-FRR.  </t>

     <t>The sole protocol extension to LDP is simply the ability to
     advertise an MRT Capability.  This document describes that
     extension and the associated behavior expected for LSRs (Label 
	 Switching Routers) and LERs (Label Edge Routers)
     advertising the MRT Capability.</t>

     <t>MRT-FRR uses LDP multi-topology extensions and requires three
     different multi-topology IDs to be allocated from the MPLS MT-ID
     space.</t>

    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This document describes the LDP signaling extension and
      associated behavior necessary to support the architecture that
      defines how IP/LDP Fast-Reroute can use MRTs <xref
      target="RFC7812"/>.  It is necessary
      to be familiar with the architecture in <xref
      target="RFC7812"/> to understand how
      and why the LDP extensions for behavior are needed.</t>

      <t>At least one common standardized algorithm (e.g. the MRT
      Lowpoint algorithm explained and fully documented in <xref
      target="RFC7811"/>) is required to be deployed so that
      the routers supporting MRT computation consistently compute the
      same MRTs.  LDP depends on an IGP for computation of MRTs and
      alternates.  Extensions to OSPF are defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ospf-mrt"/>.  Extension to IS-IS are defined in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-isis-mrt"/>. </t>

      <t>MRT can also be used to protect multicast traffic (signalled
      via PIM or mLDP) using either global protection or local
      protection as described in <xref target="I-D.atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch"/>.  An MRT
      path can be used to provide node-protection for mLDP traffic via
      the mechanisms described in <xref
      target="I-D.wijnands-mpls-mldp-node-protection"/>; an MRT path
      can also be used to provide link protection for mLDP
      traffic.</t>

      <t>For each destination, IP/LDP Fast-Reroute with MRT (MRT-FRR)
      creates two alternate destination-based trees separate from the
      shortest path forwarding used during stable operation.  LDP uses
      the multi-topology extensions <xref target="RFC7307"/> to signal
      Forwarding Equivalency Classes (FECs) for these two sets of
      forwarding trees, MRT-Blue and MRT-Red.</t>

      <t>In order to create MRT paths and support IP/LDP Fast-Reroute,
      a new capability extension is needed for LDP.  An LDP
      implementation supporting MRT MUST also follow the rules
      described here for originating and managing FECs related to MRT,
      as indicated by their multi-topology ID.  Network reconvergence
      is described in <xref
      target="RFC7812"/> and the
      worst-case network convergence time can be flooded via the
      extension in Section 7 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ospf-mrt"/>.</t>

      <t>IP/LDP Fast-Reroute using MRTs can provide 100% coverage for
      link and node failures in an arbitrary network topology where
      the failure doesn't partition the network.  It can also be
      deployed incrementally; an MRT Island is formed of connected
      supporting routers and the MRTs are computed inside that
      island.</t>

<section title="Requirements Language">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119<xref
target="RFC2119"/></t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">

<t>For ease of reading, some of the terminology defined in <xref
target="RFC7812"/> is repeated here.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

     <t hangText="Redundant Trees (RT): ">A pair of trees where the path from any node
      X to the root R along the first tree is node-disjoint with the
      path from the same node X to the root along the second tree.
      Redundant trees can always be computed in 2-connected graphs.</t>

     <t hangText="Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT): "> A pair of trees where the path
      from any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path
      from the same node X to the root along the second tree share the
      minimum number of nodes and the minimum number of links.  Each
      such shared node is a cut-vertex.  Any shared links are cut-links.
      In graphs that are not 2-connected, it is not possible to compute
      RTs.  However, it is possible to compute MRTs.  MRTs are maximally
      redundant in the sense that they are as redundant as possible
      given the constraints of the network graph.</t>

     <t hangText="MRT-Red: ">  MRT-Red is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
      used to describe the associated forwarding topology and MPLS
      Multi-Topology IDentifier (MT-ID).  Specifically, MRT-Red is the
      decreasing MRT where links in the GADAG are taken in the direction
      from a higher topologically ordered node to a lower one.</t>

     <t hangText="MRT-Blue: "> MRT-Blue is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
      used to described the associated forwarding topology and MPLS
      MT-ID.  Specifically, MRT-Blue is the increasing MRT where links
      in the GADAG are taken in the direction from a lower topologically
      ordered node to a higher one.</t>

     <t hangText="Rainbow MRT: "> It is useful to have an MPLS MT-ID that refers to the
      multiple MRT forwarding topologies and to the default forwarding
      topology.  This is referred to as the Rainbow MRT MPLS MT-ID and
      is used by LDP to reduce signaling and permit the same label to
      always be advertised to all peers for the same (MT-ID, Prefix).</t>
     
     <t hangText="MRT Island: "> The set of routers that support a particular MRT
      profile and the links connecting them that support MRT.</t>

     <t hangText="Island Border Router (IBR): ">  A router that is not in the MRT Island but is
      adjacent to an IBR and in the same area/level as the IBR.</t>
     
     <t hangText="Island Neighbor (IN): "> A router that is not in the
     MRT Island but is adjacent to an IBR and in the same area/level
     as the IBR..</t>
     

</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Overview of LDP Signaling Extensions for MRT">

<t>Routers need to know which of their LDP neighbors support MRT.
This is communicated using the MRT Capability Advertisement.
Supporting MRT indicates several different aspects of behavior, as
listed below.

<list style="numbers">

  <t>Sending and receiving multi-topology FEC elements, as defined in
  <xref target="RFC7307"/>.</t>
  
  <t>Understanding the Rainbow MRT MT-ID and applying the associated

  <t>Advertising the Rainbow MRT FEC to the appropriate neighbors for

  <t>For a FEC learned from a neighbor that does not support MRT,
  originating FECs for MRT-Red and MRT-Blue with the same prefix.
  This MRT Island egress behavior is to support an MRT Island that
  does not include all routers in the area/level.</t>
</list></t>

<section title="MRT Capability Advertisement">

<t>A new MRT Capability Parameter TLV is defined in accordance with
LDP Capability definition guidelines<xref target="RFC5561"/>.</t>

<t>The LDP MRT capability can be advertised during LDP session
initialization or after the LDP session is established. Advertisement
of the MRT capability indicates support of the procedures for
establishing the MRT-Blue and MRT-Red LSP paths detailed in this document.
If the peer has not advertised the MRT capability, then it
indicates that LSR does not support MRT procedures.</t>

<t> If a router advertises the LDP MRT capability to its peer, but the
peer has not advertised the MRT capability, then the router MUST NOT
advertise MRT-related FEC-label bindings to that peer.</t>

<t>The following is the format of the MRT Capability Parameter.</t>

"Capability" message to advertise or withdraw the capability
respectively, as described in <xref target="RFC5561"/>.</t>

</list></t>

<section title="Interaction of MRT Capability and MT Capability">
<t> An LSR advertising the LDP MRT Capability MUST also advertise the
LDP Multi-topology (MT) capability.  If an LSR negotiates LDP MRT
Capability with an LDP neighbor without also negotiating the LDP MT
Capability, the LSR MUST behave as if LDP MRT Capability has not been
negotiated and respond with the "MRT Capability negotiated without MT
Capability" status code in the LDP Notification message (defined in
the document).  The E-bit of this Notification should be set to 0 to
indicate that this is an Advisory Notification. The LDP session SHOULD
NOT be terminated.
</t>


</section>

<section title="Interaction of LDP MRT Capability with IPv4 and IPv6">
<t>The MRT LDP Capability Advertisement does not distinguish between
IPv4 and IPv6 address families.  An LSR which advertises the MRT LDP
capability is expected to advertise MRT-related FEC-label bindings for
the same address families for which it advertises shortest-path
FEC-label bindings.  Therefore, an LSR advertising MRT LDP capability
and shortest path FEC-label bindings for IPv4 only (or IPv6 only)
would be expected to advertise MRT-related FEC-label binding for IPv4
only (or IPv6 only).  An LSR advertising the MRT LDP capability and
shortest-path FEC label bindings for BOTH IPv4 and IPv6 is expected to
advertise MRT-related FEC-label bindings for BOTH IPv4 and IPv6.  In
this scenario, advertising MRT-related FEC-label bindings only for
IPv4 only (or only for IPv6) is not supported.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Use of the Rainbow MRT MT-ID">

<t>Section 10.1 of <xref
target="RFC7812"/> describes the need for
an area border router (ABR) to have different neighbors use different
MPLS labels when sending traffic to the ABR for the same FEC. More
detailed discussion of the Rainbow MRT MT-ID is provided in <xref
target="sec_rainbow"/> of the current document.
</t>

<t>Another use for the Rainbow MRT MT-ID is for an LSR to send the
Rainbow MRT MT-ID with an IMPLICIT_NULL label to indicate
penultimate-hop-popping for all three types of FECs (shortest path,
red, and blue).  The EXPLICIT_NULL label advertised using the Rainbow
MRT MT-ID similarly applies to all the types of FECs.  Note that the
only scenario in which it is generally useful to advertise the
implicit or explicit null label for all three FEC types is when the
FEC refers to the LSR itself.  See <xref target="sec_egress_lsr"/> for
more details.
</t>

<t> The value of the Rainbow MRT MPLS MT-ID (TBD-MRT-LDP-3) will be
assigned by IANA from the MPLS MT-ID space.</t>
</section>

<section title="MRT-Blue and MRT-Red FECs">

<t>To provide MRT support in LDP, the MT Prefix FEC is used.
<xref target="RFC7812"/> 
defines the Default MRT Profile.  <xref target="sec_iana"/> of the current document 
specifies the values in the MPLS Multi-Topology Identifiers Registry for 
the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue MPLS MT-IDs associated with the Default MRT Profile 
(TBD-MRT-LDP-4 and TBD-MRT-LDP-5).</t>

<t>As described in Section 8.1 of <xref target="RFC7812"/>, 
   when a new MRT Profile is defined, new and unique values should be
   allocated from the "MPLS Multi-Topology Identifiers Registry",
   corresponding to the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue MT-ID values for the new
   MRT Profile.
</t>


<t>The MT Prefix FEC encoding is defined in <xref target="RFC7307"/>
and is used without alteration for advertising label mappings for
MRT-Blue, MRT-Red and Rainbow MRT FECs.</t>

</section>

<section title="Interaction of MRT-related LDP advertisements with the MRT topology and computations">

<t> <xref target="RFC7811"/> and <xref target="RFC7812"/> describe how the MRT topology is 
created based on information in IGP advertisements.  The MRT topology and computations rely on 
on IGP advertisements.  The presence or absence of MRT-related LDP advertisements does not affect
the MRT topology or the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue next-hops computed for that topology.</t>

<t> As an example, consider a network where all nodes are running MRT IGP extensions 
to determine the MRT-topology, which is then used to compute MRT-Red and MRT-Blue next-hops.
The network operator also configures the nodes in this network to exchange MRT-related LDP 
advertisements in order to distribute MPLS labels corresponding to those MRT next-hops.  
Suppose that, due to a misconfiguration on one particular link, the MRT-related LDP advertisements
are not being properly exchanged for that link.  Since the MRT-related IGP
advertisements for the link are still being distributed, the link is still included in
the MRT topology and computations,   In this scenario, there will be missing MPLS forwarding
entries corresponding to paths that use the misconfigured link.</t>

<t> Note that the situation is analogous to the interaction of normal LDP 
advertisements and IGP advertisements for shortest path forwarding.
Deactivating the distribution of labels for normal shortest path FECs on a link
does not change the topology on which the SPF algorithm is run by the IGP.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="LDP MRT FEC Advertisements">

<t>This sections describes how and when labels for MRT-Red and
MRT-Blue FECs are advertised.  The associated LSPs must be created
before a failure occurs, in order to provide protection paths which
are immediately usable by the point of local repair in the event of a
failure.</t>

<t> In this section, we will use the term "shortest path FEC" to refer
to the usual FEC associated with the shortest path destination-based
forwarding tree for a given prefix as determined by the IGP.  We will
use the terms "red FEC" and "blue FEC" to refer to FECs associated
with the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue destination-based forwarding trees for a
given prefix as determined by a particular MRT algorithm.
</t>

<t> We first describe label distribution behavior specific to MRT.
Then we provide the correct interpretation of several important
concepts in <xref target="RFC5036"/> in the context of MRT FEC label
distribution.</t>

<section title="MRT-specific behavior">
<section anchor="sec_rainbow" title="ABR behavior and use of the Rainbow FEC">
<t>Section 10.1 of <xref
target="RFC7812"/> describes the need for
an area border router (ABR) to have different neighbors use different
MPLS labels when sending traffic to the ABR for the same FEC. The
method to accomplish this using the Rainbow MRT MT-ID is described in
detail in <xref target="RFC7812"/>.  Here
we provide a brief summary.  To those LDP peers in the same area as
the best route to the destination, the ABR advertises two different
labels corresponding to the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue forwarding trees for
the destination.  An LDP peer receiving these advertisements forwards
MRT traffic to the ABR using these two different labels, depending on
the FEC of the traffic.  We refer to this as best-area advertising and
forwarding behavior, which is identical to normal MRT behavior.
</t>

<t>For all other LDP peers supporting MRT, the ABR advertises a
FEC-label binding for the Rainbow MRT MT-ID scoped FEC with the label
corresponding to the default forwarding tree for the destination.  An
LDP peer receiving this advertisement forwards MRT traffic to the ABR
using this label, for both MRT-Red and MRT-Blue traffic.  We refer to
this as non-best-area advertising and forwarding behavior.
</t>

<t>The use of the Rainbow-FEC by the ABR for non-best-area
advertisements is RECOMMENDED.  An ABR MAY advertise the label for the
default topology in separate MRT-Blue and MRT-Red advertisements.  An
LSR advertising the MRT capability MUST recognize the Rainbow MRT
MT-ID and associate the advertised label with the specific prefix with
the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue MT-IDs associated with all MRT Profiles that
advertise LDP as the forwarding mechanism.</t>

<t> Due to changes in topology or configuration, an ABR and a given
LDP peer may need to transition from best-area advertising and
forwarding behavior to non-best-area behavior for a given destination,
and vice versa.  When the ABR requires best-area behavior for a
red(blue) FEC, it MUST withdraw any existing label mappings
advertisements for the corresponding rainbow FEC and advertise label
mappings for the red(blue) FEC.  When the ABR requires non-best-area
behavior for a red(blue) FEC, it MUST withdraw any existing label
mappings for both red and blue FECs and advertise label mappings for
the corresponding Rainbow FEC label binding.
</t>

<t> In this transition, an ABR should never advertise a red(blue) 
FEC before withdrawing the corresponding rainbow FEC (or vice versa). 
However, should this situation occur, the expected behavior of an LSR
receiving these conflicting advertisements is defined as foll
If an LSR receives a label mapping advertisement for a rainbow FEC
from an MRT LDP peer while it still retains a label mapping for the
corresponding red or blue FEC, the LSR MUST continue to use the label
mapping for the red or blue FEC, and it MUST send a Label Release
Message corresponding to the rainbow FEC label advertisement.  If an
LSR receives a label mapping advertisement for red or blue FEC while
it still retains a label mapping for the corresponding rainbow FEC,
the LSR MUST continue to use the label mapping for the rainbow FEC,
and it MUST send a Label Release Message corresponding to the red or
blue FEC label advertisement.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sec_proxy_node" title="Proxy-node attachment router behavior">
<t>Section 11.2 of <xref
target="RFC7812"/> describes how MRT
provides FRR protection for multi-homed prefixes using calculations
involving a named proxy-node.  This covers the scenario where a prefix
is originated by a router in the same area as the MRT Island, but
outside of the MRT Island.  It also covers the scenario of a prefix
being advertised by a multiple routers in the MRT Island.
</t>

<t>In the named proxy-node calculation, each multi-homed prefix is 
represented by a conceptual proxy-node which is attached to two real 
proxy-node attachment routers. (A single proxy-node attachment router is 
allowed in the case of a prefix advertised by a same area router outside 
of the MRT Island which is singly connected to the MRT Island.) All 
routers in the MRT Island perform the same calculations to determine the 
same two proxy-node attachment routers for each multi-homed prefix. 
Section 5.9 of <xref target="RFC7811"/> describes the 
procedure for identifying one proxy-node attachment router as "red" and 
one as "blue" with respect to the multi-homed prefix, and computing the 
MRT red and blue next-hops to reach those red and blue proxy-node 
attachment routers. </t> 

<t> In terms of LDP behavior, a red proxy-node attachment router for a
given prefix MUST originate a label mapping for the red FEC for that
prefix, while the a blue proxy-node attachment router for a given
prefix MUST originate a label mapping for the blue FEC for that
prefix.  If the red(blue) proxy-node attachment router is an Island
Border Router (IBR), then when it receives a packet with the label
corresponding to the red(blue) FEC for a prefix, it MUST forward the
packet to the Island Neighbor (IN) whose cost was used in the
selection of the IBR as a proxy-node attachment router.  The IBR MUST
swap the incoming label for the outgoing label corresponding to the
shortest path FEC for the prefix advertised by the IN.  In the case
where the IN does not support LDP, the IBR MUST pop the incoming label
and forward the packet to the IN.
</t>

<t> 
If the proxy-node attachment router is not an IBR, then the packet
MUST be removed from the MRT forwarding topology and sent along the
interface(s) that caused the router to advertise the prefix.  This
interface might be out of the area/level/AS.
</t>

<section title="LDP protocol procedures in the context of MRT label distribution">

<t> <xref target="RFC5036"/> specifies the LDP label distribution
procedures for shortest path FECs.  In general, the same procedures
can be applied to the distribution of label mappings for red and blue
FECs, provided that the procedures are interpreted in the context of
MRT FEC label distribution.  The correct interpretation of several
important concepts in <xref target="RFC5036"/> in the context of MRT
FEC label distribution is provided below.</t>

<section title="LDP peer in RFC5036">
<t> In the context of distributing label mappings for red and blue
FECs, we restrict LDP peer in <xref target="RFC5036"/> to mean LDP
peers for which the LDP MRT capability has been negotiated.  In order
to make this distinction clear, in this document we will use the term
"MRT LDP peer" to refer to an LDP peer for which the LDP MRT
capability has been negotiated.</t>

</section>

<section title="Next hop in RFC5036">
<t> Several procedures in <xref target="RFC5036"/> use the next hop of
a (shortest path) FEC to determine behavior.  The next hop of the
shortest path FEC is based on the shortest path forwarding tree to the
prefix associated with the FEC.  When the procedures of <xref
target="RFC5036"/> are used to distribute label mapping for red and
blue FECs, the next hop for the red/blue FEC is based on the
MRT-Red/Blue forwarding tree to the prefix associated with the FEC.
</t>

<t> For example, Appendix A.1.7. of <xref target="RFC5036"/> specifies
the response by an LSR to a change in the next hop for a FEC.  For a
shortest path FEC, the next hop may change as the result of the LSR
running a shortest path computation on a modified IGP topology
database.  For the red and blue FECs, the red and blue next hops may
change as the result of the LSR running a particular MRT algorithm on
a modified IGP topology database. </t>

<t> As another example, Section 2.6.1.2 of <xref target="RFC5036"/>
specifies how that when an LSR is using LSP Ordered Control, it may
initiate the transmission of a label mapping only for a (shortest
path) FEC for which it has a label mapping for the FEC next hop, or
for which the LSR is the egress.  The FEC next hop for a shortest path
FEC is based on the shortest path forwarding tree to the prefix
associated with the FEC.  In the context of distributing MRT LDP
labels, this procedure is understood to mean the following.  When an
LSR is using LSP Ordered Control, it may initiate the transmission of
a label mapping only for a red(blue) FEC for which it has a label
mapping for the red(blue) FEC next hop, or for which the LSR is the
egress.  The red or blue FEC next hop is based on the MRT-Red or Blue
forwarding tree to the prefix associated with the FEC.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec_egress_lsr" title="Egress LSR in RFC5036">
<t> Procedures in <xref target="RFC5036"/> related to Ordered Control
label distribution mode rely on whether or not an LSR may act as an
egress LSR for a particular FEC in order to determine whether or not
the LSR may originate a label mapping for that FEC.  The status of
being an egress LSR for a particular FEC is also used in loop
detection procedures in <xref target="RFC5036"/>.  Section 2.6.1.2 of
<xref target="RFC5036"/> specifies the conditions under which an LSR
may act as an egress LSR with respect to a particular (shortest path)
FEC.
<list style="numbers">
  <t>The (shortest path) FEC refers to the LSR itself (including one
  of its directly attached interfaces). </t>
  <t>The next hop router for the (shortest path) FEC is outside of the
  Label Switching Network. </t>
  <t>(Shortest path) FEC elements are reachable by crossing a routing
  domain boundary.</t>
</list>  
</t>
   
<t> The conditions for determining an egress LSR with respect to a red
or blue FEC need to be modified.  An LSR may act as an egress LSR with
respect to a particular red(blue) FEC under any of the following
conditions:

<list style="numbers">
  <t>The prefix associated with the red(blue) FEC refers to the LSR
  itself (including one of its directly attached interfaces). </t>
  <t>The LSR is the red(blue) proxy-node attachment router with
  respect to the multi-homed prefix associated with the red(blue) FEC.
  This includes the degenerate case of a single red and blue
  proxy-node attachment router for a single-homed prefix.</t>
  <t>The LSR is an area border router (ABR) AND the MRT LDP peer
  requires non-best-area advertising and forwarding behavior for the
  prefix associated with the FEC.</t>
</list> 
</t>

<t> Note that condition(3) scopes an LSR's status as an egress LSR
with respect to a particular FEC to a particular MRT LDP peer.
Therefore, the condition "Is LSR egress for FEC?" that occurs in
several procedures in <xref target="RFC5036"/> needs to be interpreted
as "Is LSR egress for FEC with respect to Peer?"  </t>

<t> Also note that there is no explicit condition that allows an LSR
to be classified as an egress LSR with respect a red or blue FEC based
only on the primary next-hop for the shortest path FEC not supporting
LDP, or not supporting LDP MRT capability.  These situations are
covered by the proxy-node attachment router and ABR conditions
(conditions 2 and 3).  In particular, an Island Border Router is not
the egress LSR for a red(blue) FEC unless it is also the red(blue)
proxy-node attachment router for that FEC.
</t>

<t> Also note that in general a proxy-node attachment router for a
given prefix should not advertise an implicit or explicit null label
for the corresponding red or blue FEC, even though it may be an egress
LSR for the shortest path FEC.  In general, the proxy-node attachment
router needs to forward red or blue traffic for that prefix to a
particular loop free island neighbor, which may be different from the
shortest path next-hop.  The proxy-node attachment router needs to
receive the red or blue traffic with a non-null label to correctly
forward it.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Use of Rainbow FEC to satisfy label mapping existence requirements in RFC5036">
<t>Several procedures in <xref target="RFC5036"/> require the LSR to
determine if it has previously received and retained a label mapping
for a FEC from the next hop.  In the case of an LSR that has received
and retained a label mapping for a Rainbow FEC from an ABR, the label
mapping for the Rainbow FEC satisfies the label mapping existence
requirement for the corresponding red and blue FECs.  Label mapping
existence requirements in the context of MRT LDP label distribution
are modified as: "Has LSR previously received and retained a label
mapping for the red(blue) FEC (or the corresponding Rainbow FEC) from
the red(blue) next hop?"
</t>
<t>As an example, this behavior allows an LSR which has received and
retained a label mapping for the Rainbow FEC to advertise label
mappings for the corresponding red and blue FECs when operating in
Ordered Control label distribution mode.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Validating FECs in routing table">
   
<t> In <xref target="RFC5036"/> an LSR uses its routing table to
validate prefixes associated with shortest path FECs.  For example,
section 3.5.7.1 of <xref target="RFC5036"/> specifies that "an LSR
receiving a Label Mapping message from a downstream LSR for a Prefix
SHOULD NOT use the label for forwarding unless its routing table
contains an entry that exactly matches the FEC Element."  In the
context of MRT FECs, a red or blue FEC element matches a routing table
entry if the corresponding shortest path FEC element matches a routing
table entry.
 </t>
   
</section>

<section title="Recognizing new FECs">
   
<t> Section A.1.6 of <xref target="RFC5036"/> describes the response
of an LSR to the "Recognize New FEC" event, which occurs when an LSR
learns a new (shortest path) FEC via the routing table.  In the
context of MRT FECs, when MRT LDP capability has been enabled, when an
LSR learns a new shortest path FEC, it should generate "Recognize New
FEC" events for the corresponding red and blue FECs, in addition to
the "Recognize New FEC" event for the shortest path FEC.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Not propagating Rainbow FEC label mappings">
   
<t> A label mapping for the Rainbow FEC should only be originated by
an ABR under the conditions described in <xref target="sec_rainbow"/>.
A neighbor of the ABR that receives a label mapping for the Rainbow
FEC MUST NOT propagate a label mapping for that Rainbow FEC.
 </t>
   
</section>

</section>

</section>



<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>The labels distributed by the extensions in this document create
additional forwarding paths that do not follow shortest path
routes.  The transit label swapping operations defining these
alternative forwarding paths are created during normal operations
(before a failure occurs).  Therefore, a malicious packet with an
appropriate label injected into the network from a compromised
location would be forwarded to a destination along a non-shortest
path.  When this technology is deployed, a network security design
should not rely on assumptions about potentially malicious traffic
only following shortest paths.</t>

<t>It should be noted that the creation of non-shortest forwarding
paths is not unique to MRT.  For example, RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"/>
can be used to construct forwarding paths that do not follow the shortest path.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Potential restrictions on MRT-related MT-ID values 
imposed by RFC6420">
<t> As discussed in the introduction, in addition 
to unicast forwarding applications, MRT can be used to provide disjoint 
trees for multicast traffic distribution. In the case of PIM, this is 
accomplished by using the MRT red and blue next-hops as the PIM RPF 
topology, the collection of routes used by PIM to perform the RPF 
operation when building source trees. The PIM Multi-Topology ID (MT-ID) 
Join Attribute defined in section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC6420"/> can be 
used to establish MRT-based multicast distribution trees. <xref 
target="RFC6420"/> limits the values of the PIM MT-ID from 1 through 
4095.</t>

<t>For the purpose of reducing management overhead and simplifying 
troubleshooting, it is desirable to be able to use the same numerical 
value for the PIM MT-ID as for the MPLS MT-ID, for multicast and unicast 
application using MRT routes constructed using the same MRT profile. In 
order to enable this simplification, the MPLS MT-ID values assigned in 
this document need to fall in the range 1 through 4095. The IANA request 
below reflects this by requesting that the MPLS MT-ID values from 3945 
through 3995 be used for MRT-related MPLS MT-ID values. This allows for 
51 MRT-related MPLS MT-ID values which can be directly mapped to PIM 
MT-ID values, which accommodates 25 MRT profiles with red and blue MT-ID 
pairs, with one extra for the rainbow MPLS MT-ID value. <xref 
target="RFC7307"/> designates the MPLS MT-ID range 6-3995 as 
"Unassigned(for future IGP topologies)". The IANA request below changes 
the guidance for MT-ID range 3948-3995 to "Unassigned (for future 
MRT-related values)".
